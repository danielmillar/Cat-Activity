## Installation
### From Marketplace
You can download the plugin from the [JetBrains Marketplace page](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/24065-cat-activity). Alternatively, you can search for "Cat Activity" in the IDE (Settings -> Plugins -> Marketplace)

### From Release
Moderation on the Marketplace usually takes up to two business days. If you want the latest version right now, you can download the ZIP file with the plugin from the [Releases](https://github.com/wavy-cat/cat-activity/releases/). It doesn't need to be unpacked.

In IDE go to Plugins (in settings), click on the gear, select "Install Plugin from Disk..." and specify the path to the downloaded ZIP file.

### From Actions
Similar to downloading from Release, you only need to extract the archive with the plugin once from the artifacts of the last successful run of the [Build Plugin workflow](https://github.com/wavy-cat/cat-activity/actions/workflows/build.yml).


## Report a bug
Send any bugs you find to the [Issue](https://github.com/wavy-cat/cat-activity/issues) page. However, if you can fix it, it would be better to send a [Pull request](https://github.com/wavy-cat/cat-activity/pulls).

## Supported IDE
All of them, including Android Studio. Some IDEs, such as MPS and AppCode, may not have an icon. In this case, a fallback icon will be used.
JetBrains Gateway, JetBrains Client, and Code With Me Guest are not supported.

## How to request adding an icon?
Create an Issue and write in it the name of the language, framework or technology you want to see specified in the [Catppuccin icons](https://github.com/catppuccin/vscode-icons).

Images from another icon set are reject yet.
