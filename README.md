# Wave Discord

Plugin for Jetbrains IDE to show your activity in your Discord profile.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a fork of [re-ovo/discord-ij](https://github.com/re-ovo/discord-ij) repository with added icons from [Catppuccin icons](https://github.com/catppuccin/vscode-icons).
> 
> Also, WavyCat is not a Kotlin developer, so the code may use primitive and not the best solutions.
